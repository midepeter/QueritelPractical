#Overview
This project is an interview exercise which involves training a computer vision model on any handwritten dataset which includes arithmetic symbols for future simple evaluations of detected digits.

The dataset was source from https://www.kaggle.com/clarencezhao/handwritten-math-symbol-dataset?select=train which was trained on a convolutional neural network built from scratch and has an accuracy of 0.5 on its validation datase. 

It was built using tensorflow v2 and was trained using the sequential model with different layers with its respective parameters to give the accuracy
